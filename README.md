# Generative-AI
This repository contains a web application built with Streamlit that utilizes Stable Diffusion models from Hugging Face's diffusers library to generate images from textual descriptions. The app allows users to select different models and input their own descriptions to see the generated images.

 # Features
Interactive Web Interface: Built using Streamlit, the app provides an easy-to-use interface where users can select from multiple pre-trained Stable Diffusion models and input text to generate images.
Multiple Model Support: Includes support for several versions of Stable Diffusion models, such as "dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0", "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", and "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", allowing users to explore different styles and capabilities.
GPU Acceleration: The application is configured to utilize GPU acceleration if available, ensuring faster processing times for image generation.
Accessible Anywhere: The Gradio app can be run locally or deployed on a server, providing access from anywhere via a web browser.
